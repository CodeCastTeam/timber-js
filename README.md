[Timber.io](https://timber.io) is a hosted service for aggregating logs across your entire stack - any language, any platform, any data source.

Unlike traditional logging tools with proprietary log formats and protocols, Timber lets you capture system logs, visitor stats, user events and any other kind of log you wish to track, in whatever format makes sense for your app.

Environment-aware meta and relevant context data is added to your logs automatically, and Timber's rich free-form query tools and real-time tailing, make drilling down into important stats easier than ever.

The result: Beautiful, fast, powerful logging.

## Universal Javascript logging

Node.js and the browser are two of many [languages](https://docs.timber.io/languages/) and [platforms](https://docs.timber.io/platforms/) we support with an official logging library.

This Javascript library features:

- **Universal Node/browser support**. Log user/system errors, visits, clicks, events - _anything_ - in Chrome, Safari, Edge, or on a Node.js server, and search logs in real-time via the [Timber.io console](https://timber.io).

- **NPM or CDN**. Use natively in your app, Webpack/Rollup into your Node/browser bundle, or just drop in a `<script>` tag to your final HTML. Integrates easily into any app.

- **Written in Typescript; runs anywhere**. Enjoy a fully typed API, whether you use Typescript or plain JS. Plays nicely with any view engine (React, Angular, Vue, jQuery, etc), any web server (Express, Koa, HAPI, a static SPA, etc), and any back-end stack you can think of.

- **Blazing fast**. Queue 100 logs in ~1.5ms, with automatic background syncing, batching and throttling with Timber.io, optimising network I/O and reducing CPU load.

- **Guaranteed consistency**. `timber.log()` returns a Promise that resolves when the log has been ACK'd by Timber, so you know your log has been stored safely.

- **Easy logging middleware**. Pass an async func to `timber.use()` to chain your own transforms or log middleware; `.log()` only resolves when all middleware complete!

- **Light as a feather.** The gzipped browser bundle weighs in at just **4.3kb**!

- **Plays nicely with other loggers**. Using Bunyan or Winston? Official integrations are coming soon.

## Installation

### Quick Start

First, install the universal Timber JS library:

```
npm i @timberio/js
```

Then in your code, import the relevant logger -- either `Browser` (for any web browser) or `Node` for Node.js logging:

```typescript
import { Browser, Node } from "@timberio/js";

// Create either a browser logger...
const browserLogger = new Browser("timber-api-key");

// ... or a Node logger (or both!)
const nodeLogger = new Node("timber-api-key");

// You can log by .debug, .info, .warn or .error -- returns a Promise
browserLogger.info("Hello from the browser!").then(log => {
  // At this point, your log is synced with Timber.io!
});
```

### Custom

Logging works in Node.js or the browser. Choose the appropriate lib for installation instructions:

| Package                                 | What's it for?                               |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| [`@timberio/node`](packages/node)       | Node.js logger                               |
| [`@timberio/browser`](packages/browser) | Browser logger                               |
| [`@timberio/js`](packages/js)           | Node.js/browser logging, in a single package |

### Helper libraries

There are a few helper libraries available that you typically won't need to use directly:

| Package                             | What's it for?                                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [`@timberio/core`](packages/core)   | Core library to extend for custom loggers                          |
| [`@timberio/tools`](packages/tools) | Tools/utils used by loggers for throttling, batching, queuing logs |
| [`@timberio/types`](packages/types) | Shared Typescript types                                            |

## Integrations

Coming soon - Bunyan, Winston and more.

## FAQs

**Which package should I install to start logging?**

For most Javascript projects, just `npm i @timberio/js`.

This will install both the [Node.js](packages/node) and [browser](packages/browser) versions in a single package.

Alternatively, if you only need to log in a single environment, import [`@timberio/browser`](packages/browser) or [`@timberio/node`](packages/node) directly.

**Why are there separate loggers for Node/the browser?**

Both loggers extend [`@timberio/core`](packages/core), and share the same `.log()` API.

But each offer unique features optimized for the target environment.

For example, the browser version uses built-in features of a client's web browser and client-side `fetch()` to synchronize logs with Timber.io. The result is a fast, and nimble `<script>` tag or bundle that drops easily into any client-side app.

The Node version includes features such as _msgpack_ encoding, logging from streams and deep exception handling (coming soon!), which are specific to Node.js and would have no purpose in a client-side logger.

Importing a distinct version of the logger makes it simple for bundlers like [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) or [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to leave out the parts that aren't required in the browser, resulting in a much smaller download &mdash; only 4.3kb!

**Are Typescript types available?**

Yes! Every part of the Timber JS library is written in Typescript, so you get full types (and documentation) right out-the-box.

**The root `package.json` is named `@timberio/logger` - do I need to import this?**

Nope. This library and its associated components are laid out as a mono-repo using [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna), to make it easier to maintain all code from one home on Github.

`@timberio/logger` is the private name that governs all code, tests and other stuff that only concerns the maintainers of this library, and is not importable.

Instead, simply use [`@timberio/js`](packages/js)

**Do you accept PRs / feature suggestions?**

Right now, the best way to have a feature considered is to make a suggestion using [git issues](issues).

Soon, we'll have contribution guidelines and will be accept community code submissions at that time.
